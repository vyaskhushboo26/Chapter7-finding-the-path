Chapter 07 started with the recap of previous chapter's important concepts like useEffect(), do's and don't while creating components and state. As the name suggests, this chapter is about creating routes to different pages of the application and how to navigate through them. We used a library called react-router-dom for enabling the routes and providing them to RouterProvider to render them in the root. Error component for the invalid path were explaned. Importance of SPA (Single Page Application) and different types of routing were explained. Other routing concepts like nested routing (loading children into the parent outlet), dynamic routing (passing dynamic param in the path) were implemented. Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in theory-assignment.md. InstaFood(Version 3.0) app also had lot of enhancements in this chapter, like menu page was created for each restaurant, navigation to various pages of the application is done. Check coding-assignment.md for all the features that I implemented in this chapter.

One line about this chapter : In Single Page Applications (SPA), any parts of the page (components) can be loaded without refreshing/ reloading the whole page.

Check out Chapter-07 Live for the live demo of this chapter's coding assignment (InstaFood Version 3.0). Also check out the following chapters to see how InstaFood has progressed. Happy Reacting !!!
